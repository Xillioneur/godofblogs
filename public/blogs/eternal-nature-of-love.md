# The Eternal Nature of Love

God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God in him. In the digital age, we often forget that the most powerful algorithm is the one written in the heart.

## Life as a Gift
Every breath is a line of code in the grand design. We do not exist by accident; we exist by intentional, divine will.

### The Purpose
- To love one another.
- To seek the truth.
- To live in harmony with the Creator.

> "And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love." — 1 Corinthians 13:13
