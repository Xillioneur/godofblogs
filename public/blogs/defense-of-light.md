# The Defense of Light

In a world that often prefers the shadows of ambiguity, the Light of Truth stands as a resolute fortress. To defend the faith is not to engage in strife, but to offer a sanctuary of clarity.

## The Architecture of Certainty
Truth is not a variable; it is a constant. Like the mathematical precision of the cosmos, the moral law is written into the very fabric of our being.

### Standing Against Criticism
When the world critiques the Divine, it often does so from a place of finite understanding. Our role is to:
- **Listen with Grace**: Understanding the root of the question.
- **Speak with Clarity**: Presenting the logic of the Logos.
- **Live with Integrity**: Letting our lives be the ultimate proof.

> "But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be ready to give a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear." — 1 Peter 3:15

The strongest defense is a life fully illuminated by the Spirit.
