# The Sovereignty of the Creator

To understand the world, one must first look to the One who spoke it into being. God is not a distant architect, but a present Father.

## The Logic of Creation
Every law of physics, every mathematical constant, and every strand of DNA is a testament to Divine Intellect. 

### Why We Seek Him
- **Source of Truth**: Without God, truth is relative. With Him, it is absolute.
- **Source of Hope**: In a finite world, He is the Infinite.
- **Source of Life**: He is the breath in our lungs and the light in our eyes.
