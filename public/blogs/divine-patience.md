# Understanding Divine Patience

In an era of instant gratification and high-speed connections, the concept of "waiting" feels like a system error. Yet, God often works in the pauses, the transitions, and the long seasons of growth.

## The Wisdom of the Wait
Patience is not just about time; it is about the posture of the heart during the interval.

### Why the Delay?
- **Character Development**: Like a slow-rendered image, quality takes time.
- **Alignment**: Ensuring we are ready for the destination.
- **Trust**: Learning to rely on the Provider rather than the provision.

> "But those who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint." — Isaiah 40:31

God is never late, but He is rarely early. He is always exactly on time.
